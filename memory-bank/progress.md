| Overall Project | In Progress | 40% |

## What's Working

- ✅ Project architecture and foundation
- ✅ Three.js integration with scene, camera, and renderer
- ✅ Rapier physics integration with world setup
- ✅ Game loop implementation
- ✅ Entity system with ball and terrain
- ✅ Physics synchronization between visual and physics objects
- ✅ Singleton pattern implementation for core managers

## What's In Progress

- 🔄 Shot control system
- 🔄 Aiming mechanism (currently not working correctly)
- 🔄 Input handling for keyboard/mouse controls

- 🔄 UI feedback during shot execution

## What's Next (Upcoming Tasks)

1. Debug and fix the aiming functionality
2. Implement proper input handling for aim direction
3. Enhance the aim arrow visualization
4. Refine the shot power mechanics
5. Add spin controls to shots
6. Implement different shot types (grounder vs. fly)
7. Create more complex terrain with different surfaces

## Known Issues & Blockers

- 🐛 **Shot Aiming Not Working**: The aiming function isn't working correctly. UI button for shooting works, but aiming direction control is not functioning.
- 🐛 Need proper input handling for keyboard/mouse controls
- 🐛 Aim arrow visualization may not be updating properly
- 🐛 Potential issues with state transitions during aiming process

## Technical Debt

- Cleanup of temp code used during prototyping
- Need more robust error handling for physics initialization
- Input system needs abstraction layer for better maintainability

## Development Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| FPS | 60 | ~60 (needs optimization) |
| Load Time | <5s | ~3s (initial load) |
| Build Size | <5MB | ~2MB (current build) |
| Physics Bodies | <100 | 2 (ball and terrain) |
| Draw Calls | <50 | ~10 (current scene) |

## Lessons Learned So Far

- Async initialization of Rapier WASM requires careful handling
- Singleton pattern is effective for manager classes but needs proper implementation
- Three.js and Rapier integration works well but requires manual synchronization
- Game state management is crucial for coordinating complex interactions
- UI integration needs close coordination with core game mechanics
- Proper error handling is essential for debugging physics issues

## Immediate Focus

- Debug the shot aiming functionality to understand why direction control isn't working
- Examine the input handling code in ShotController
- Review the arrow visualization implementation
- Test state transitions during the aiming process
- Ensure proper coordination between game states and shot mechanics

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Shot mechanics feel unsatisfying | Medium | High | Iterative refinement, adjustable parameters |
| Physics glitches with complex terrain | High | Medium | Thorough testing, collision refinement |
| Performance issues with many entities | Medium | Medium | Optimization, object pooling |
| Camera issues with complex courses | Medium | Medium | Multiple camera modes, testing |
| Browser compatibility | Low | Medium | Target modern browsers, feature detection |
