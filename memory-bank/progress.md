# Progress: Cosmic Rollers

## Current Project Status: Kirby-Style Shot System Phase 0 and Phase 1 Implemented

We've successfully enhanced our shot system with core Kirby's Dream Course mechanics, including shot type selection (Phase 0), improved direction selection (Phase 1), and guide length selection (Phase 2). The implementation allows players to toggle between grounder and fly shots, select aim direction, and choose trajectory guide length, with the physics engine correctly differentiating between shot types. We've also fixed critical issues with ball movement, state transitions, and input handling.
