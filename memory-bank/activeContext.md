## Current Focus: Implementing Kirby-Style Shot System and Fixing Critical Gameplay Issues

### Recent Implementation: Power Meter Enhancements and Spin Control System

We've successfully implemented additional components of our enhanced Kirby-style shot system:

1. **Phase 0: Shot Type Selection**
   - Added new `SELECTING_TYPE` state to `GameState` enum
   - Created `ShotTypeController` to handle shot type selection phase
   - Implemented `ShotTypeUI` for visual feedback when selecting shot types
   - Added toggle between Grounder and Fly shots using Up/Down arrow keys

### Current Shot System Implementation

Our implementation now follows the Kirby's Dream Course shot system more closely:

1. **Phase 0: Shot Type Selection**
   - Player selects between Grounder and Fly shots
   - Up/Down arrows toggle type, Space confirms
   - Visual UI shows current selection with color feedback

2. **Phase 1: Aiming**
   - Player selects direction using Left/Right arrows
   - Red aim arrow visualizes direction
   - Space confirms direction and moves to next phase

3. **Phase 2: Guide Length Selection**
   - Player selects trajectory guide length (SHORT/LONG)
   - Yellow trajectory line shows predicted path
   - Different visualization based on shot type
   - Space confirms and moves to power selection

4. **Phase 3: Power and Spin Setting**
   - Non-looping power meter that increases then decreases (Kirby style)
   - Visual feedback with color changes based on power level
   - "Super Shot" indicator when power reaches 95-100%
   - Shift+Arrow keys for spin selection:
     - Shift+Left/Right for left/right spin
     - Shift+Up/Down for top/back spin
     - Opposite directions cancel to neutral spin
   - Ground shots have faster power increase than fly shots
   - Super shots get 5% power bonus and 20% height bonus for fly shots

5. **Phase 4: In-Motion Interaction**
   - Ball follows physics based on shot type and spin parameters
   - Boost opportunities at bounce points
   - Space activates boost during opportunity window

This streamlines the control scheme and makes the game more intuitive to play, matching the simplified control scheme of Kirby's Dream Course while maintaining all the depth of the original mechanics.

  1. Added isResettingBall flag to prevent overlapping resets
  2. Implemented 500ms debounce timer to prevent rapid resets
  3. Used the ball's reset method for complete reset including velocity zeroing
  4. Added state checking to prevent unnecessary state transitions

## Current Development Focus

### Trajectory Visualization Enhancement: Kirby-Style Fixed-Power Trajectory

The current priority is enhancing the trajectory visualization system to better match Kirby's Dream Course mechanics. After reviewing both the original game's behavior and our current implementation, we plan to make these specific changes:

#### Current Implementation Issues:
- Trajectory visualization currently updates dynamically based on power meter value
- This differs from Kirby's system which shows a fixed "target" trajectory at maximum power
- Current implementation doesn't clearly differentiate between perfect (super shot) execution and lesser power shots

#### Planned Trajectory System Changes:

1. **Fixed-Power Visualization**:
   - Modify `TrajectorySystem` to always visualize trajectory at maximum power (100%)
   - Create a fixed "target" path that remains consistent during power meter oscillation
   - This gives players a visual target to aim for with their timing

2. **Precision-Based Shot Execution**:
   - Only super shots (95-100% power) will follow the predicted trajectory precisely
   - Lesser power shots will deviate from the trajectory proportionally to power level
   - Implement this in `ShotPhysics.executeShot()` calculations

3. **Enhanced Visual Differentiation**:
   - Improve visual distinction between Grounder and Fly Shot trajectories
   - Add clearer bounce point indicators
   - Implement different line styles/colors based on shot type

4. **Shot Guide Integration**:
   - Maintain guide distance limiting in the SHOT_PANEL and CHARGING states
   - Ensure consistency with guide length selection

5. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Modify `updateTrajectoryVisualization()` in `ShotController` to use fixed 100% power
   - Update `TrajectoryRenderer` to better indicate max power path vs. actual shot
   - Adjust `ShotPhysics` to handle how different power levels affect trajectory adherence

These changes will create a more authentic Kirby's Dream Course experience, where the trajectory line serves as a "target" that players aim to hit with precise timing on the power meter, rather than the line simply adjusting to match whatever power level they're at.

### Other Ongoing Development

Our next-generation mini-golf game with Kirby-inspired mechanics continues to evolve. We've recently:

- Implemented non-looping Kirby-style power meter with precise 2-second timing
- Added precise 0.033-second boost timing window after bounces
- Implemented super shot visual effects and mechanics

### Technical Direction

We're focusing on precise gameplay mechanics that recreate the original Kirby's Dream Course feel:

- Frame-rate independent timing using performance.now() for consistent experience
- Physics-based trajectory prediction with proper spin effects
- Matching the original game's precise timing windows

### Current Priorities

1. **Trajectory Visualization System**: Update for fixed-power display (described above)
2. **Spin Physics Refinement**: Further improve spin physics and visualization
3. **Environment Interaction**: Enhance how the ball interacts with different surfaces

### Recent Implementation Decisions

- Power meter now uses exact 2-second timing to match Kirby's Dream Course
- Boost system implements the precise 0.033-second timing window (2 frames at 60FPS)
- Enhanced feedback systems for timing windows to help players master the mechanics

### Next Steps

1. Implement the trajectory visualization changes (current priority)
2. Test and refine the power meter and boost timing mechanics
3. Further enhance spin control system
4. Continue improving course elements and obstacles

## Technical Patterns

- Use frame-rate independent calculations for consistent experience across devices
- Leverage Three.js for visualization and Rapier for physics
- Maintain clear separation between game state, physics simulation, and visualization
