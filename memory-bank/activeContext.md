# Active Context: Cosmic Rollers

## Current Focus: Shot Mechanics Implementation

We are currently implementing the core game mechanics with a focus on the shot controls system. We've established the basic architecture and have implemented core components including physics integration, game loop, and basic entity relationships.

### Recent Activities

- Created core game architecture with Three.js for rendering and Rapier for physics
- Implemented the singleton Game class managing initialization and game loop
- Developed entity system with BallEntity and TerrainEntity
- Set up camera controller for isometric view
- Implemented ShotController for player shot mechanics
- Added basic UI with power meter and shoot button in HTML
- Connected game.fireShot method to the UI's shoot button

### Current State

- Core game architecture is implemented and functioning
- Physics integration with Rapier is working
- Basic shot firing mechanism is implemented
- UI control for firing shots is operational
- Entity system foundations are in place
- Game state management system established

## Key Decisions in Progress

### Architecture Decisions
- Evaluating modular structure for maintainability vs performance
- Considering different approaches to physics integration with Three.js
- Determining the optimal approach for procedural generation pipeline

### Implementation Priorities
- Fixing the shot aiming mechanism is the immediate priority
- Refining ball physics and collision response
- Improving camera behavior for shot aiming and ball following
- Enhancing user feedback during shot execution

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Investigate and fix the aiming function in ShotController
2. Connect keyboard/mouse inputs properly to the aiming controls
3. Improve the aim arrow visualization for better feedback
4. Implement proper state transitions during the aiming process
5. Add more feedback for shot power and direction

### Short-term Goals
- Create a minimal playable prototype with working physics and shot mechanics
- Implement the complete shot mechanics (aim, power, spin)
- Add simple collision detection between ball and terrain
- Refine camera follow behavior with isometric perspective

### Medium-term Goals
- Implement complete shot system with different shot types
- Add targets and obstacles with appropriate physics
- Create basic procedural terrain generation
- Develop win conditions and score tracking

## Open Questions and Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- Ensuring smooth sync between Three.js visuals and Rapier physics
- Properly handling input for aiming direction
- Creating intuitive aiming controls that work well with isometric perspective
- Managing game state transitions between aiming, charging, and rolling states

### Current Issues
- **Shot Aiming Not Working**: The aiming function isn't working properly. The interface allows firing shots with the shoot button, but aiming direction control is not functioning correctly.
- Need to determine if the issue is with input handling, arrow visualization, or angle calculation
- The aim arrow may not be updating correctly in response to user input

## Recent Insights

- Physics integration requires careful handling of async WASM initialization
- Shot mechanics need to balance precision with accessibility
- Game state management is essential for coordinating the shot sequence (aim → charge → execute)
- UI integration requires careful coordination with the core game mechanics

## Collaboration Notes

- Next session will focus on debugging the aiming mechanism
- We should examine the input handling in ShotController
- The aim arrow visualization code needs review
- We need to test the interaction between game states and the aiming process

# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are starting the project setup and initializing the Memory Bank to establish clear documentation for the Cosmic Rollers golf game. Our immediate focus is on:

1. Setting up the project structure
2. Establishing development standards (300-500 lines per file)
3. Documenting the game architecture and systems
4. Preparing for Phase 1 implementation

## Recent Changes
- Initialized the Memory Bank with core documentation files
- Documented the project overview, requirements, and technical specifications
- Established key architectural patterns and code organization guidelines

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Current Sprint)
1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Create project scaffolding with Vite, React, and TypeScript
   - Set up ESLint, Prettier, and testing frameworks
   - Initialize repository with proper structure

2. **Core Framework Setup**:
   - Set up ECSY and ECSY-Three integration
   - Implement basic Three.js rendering pipeline
   - Create responsive canvas container

3. **Physics Foundation**:
   - Integrate Rapier physics
   - Create basic physics world setup
   - Implement physics abstraction layer

### Short Term (Next Sprint)
1. **Ball Physics**:
   - Implement basic ball movement physics
   - Create test environment for physics tuning
   - Add initial collision detection

2. **Camera System**:
   - Implement isometric camera with proper angle
   - Add camera control behaviors
   - Setup camera state machine

3. **Simple Terrain**:
   - Create basic flat terrain for testing
   - Implement collision with terrain
   - Add simple visual representation

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **ECSY vs Alternative ECS**: Selected ECSY for its integration with Three.js and active community
- **React Integration Strategy**: Deciding between react-three-fiber and direct Three.js integration
- **Physics Integration**: Evaluating optimal WASM loading strategy for Rapier

### Open Questions
- How to structure the physics abstraction layer for potential engine swapping?
- What's the optimal approach for serializing course data?
- How to handle cross-platform input consistently?
- Best approach for implementing the three-phase shot system?

### Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Physics performance on low-end devices | Early optimization, quality tiers |
| Complexity of wall-clinging mechanics | Early prototyping, simplified initial version |
| Cross-browser compatibility | Automated testing on multiple platforms |
| Asset loading times | Progressive loading, asset optimization pipeline |

## Current Blockers
- None at present - project initialization phase
