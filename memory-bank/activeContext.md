# Active Context: Cosmic Rollers

## Current Focus: Implementing Kirby-Style Shot System and Fixing Critical Gameplay Issues

### Recent Implementation: Phase-Based Shot System with Type Selection and Guide Length

We've successfully implemented the first two phases of our enhanced Kirby-style shot system:

1. **Phase 0: Shot Type Selection**
   - Added new `SELECTING_TYPE` state to `GameState` enum
   - Created `ShotTypeController` to handle shot type selection phase
   - Implemented `ShotTypeUI` for visual feedback when selecting shot types
   - Added toggle between Grounder and Fly shots using Up/Down arrow keys
   - Created proper state transitions: IDLE → SELECTING_TYPE → AIMING
   - Fixed input handling to only emit events in appropriate states

2. **Phase 1: Direction Selection**
   - Enhanced `AimingController` to properly integrate with new shot type phase
   - Fixed state transitions to prevent IDLE → AIMING direct transitions
   - Improved aim arrow visualization with better positioning and feedback

3. **Phase 2: Guide Length Selection**
   - Implemented `ShotPanelController` for guide length selection
   - Added toggle between SHORT and LONG guide using Up/Down arrow keys
   - Modified `TrajectorySystem` to visualize shots differently based on type

4. **Shot Type Physics Differentiation**
   - Implemented distinct physics parameters for Grounder vs Fly shots
   - Grounder shots: more horizontal momentum, less bounce, higher friction
   - Fly shots: significant upward component, better bounce energy retention
   - Modified `TrajectorySimulator` to accurately predict paths for both shot types
   - Updated visualization for different trajectories to help player planning

5. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed "Ball out of bounds" spam by adding proper debouncing (500ms timeout)
   - Corrected invalid state transitions with better validation
   - Improved ball reset logic to use the ball's reset method properly
   - Enhanced InputManager to only emit aim events in AIMING and CHARGING states

### Current Shot System Implementation

Our implementation now follows the Kirby's Dream Course shot system more closely:

1. **Phase 0: Shot Type Selection**
   - Player selects between Grounder and Fly shots
   - Up/Down arrows toggle type, Space confirms
   - Visual UI shows current selection with color feedback

2. **Phase 1: Aiming**
   - Player selects direction using Left/Right arrows
   - Red aim arrow visualizes direction
   - Space confirms direction and moves to next phase

3. **Phase 2: Guide Length Selection**
   - Player selects trajectory guide length (SHORT/LONG)
   - Yellow trajectory line shows predicted path
   - Different visualization based on shot type
   - Space confirms and moves to power selection

4. **Phase 3: Power and Spin Setting**
   - Player activates power meter with Space
   - Release Space to lock power and execute shot
   - Power determines initial velocity
   - Visual feedback for power level

5. **Phase 4: In-Motion Interaction**
   - Ball follows physics based on shot type
   - Boost opportunities at bounce points
   - Space activates boost during opportunity window

This streamlines the control scheme and makes the game more intuitive to play, matching the simplified control scheme of Kirby's Dream Course while maintaining all the depth of the original mechanics.

### Implementation Plan: Continuing Kirby-Style Shot System

Next steps in our implementation plan:

1. **Refine Shot Type Visualization**
   - Add visual indicators for trajectory differences
   - Improve shot type UI to match game aesthetic
   - Add particle effects for different shot types

2. **Enhance Power Meter**
   - Modify `PowerController` to be non-looping
   - Add visual feedback for "Super Shot" at 100%
   - Implement power-to-distance relationships specific to each shot type

3. **Spin Control System**
   - Create new `SpinController` component
   - Add left/right spin controls with visual feedback
   - For fly shots, implement vertical spin mechanic during power setting
   - Modify physics application to account for spin parameters

4. **Boost System Enhancements**
   - Improve collision detection for "boostable" moments
   - Add visual and audio feedback for successful boosts
   - Implement timing-based boost mechanic with better feedback

### Critical Issues to Address

1. **Ball Not Moving After Charging State** ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Issue**: The ball was not shooting after the CHARGING state, jumping straight from CHARGING to ROLLING to IDLE without applying forces
   - **Root Cause**: Race condition between PowerController and ShotController during state transitions
   - **Fix Implemented**:
     - Added 100ms delay in ShotController.handleShotExecute() before changing state
     - Modified PowerController to not change game state during handleShotExecute()
     - Enhanced ShotPhysics.executeShot() with stronger forces and debugging
     - Improved BallEntity with better wake-up and velocity detection

2. **Ball Reset Issues** ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Issue**: Multiple "Ball out of bounds" resets occurring in quick succession
   - **Root Cause**: Reset logic executing too frequently without proper debouncing
   - **Fix Implemented**:
     - Added 500ms debounce timer for ball reset operations
     - Added `isResettingBall` flag to prevent overlapping resets
     - Used the ball's reset method to properly handle velocity zeroing

3. **Input Event Handling Issues** ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Issue**: Inputs triggering events during inappropriate states
   - **Root Cause**: Event handling not properly checking current game state
   - **Fix Implemented**:
     - Enhanced InputManager to only emit events in appropriate states
     - Fixed state transition validation to prevent invalid transitions
     - Added more explicit debug output for invalid transitions

- Careful state management is essential for preventing race conditions
- Proper debouncing is critical for handling physics edge cases

## Implementation Notes

### Bug Fix: Ball Movement Event Recursion
- Problem: Infinite recursion occurring when handling ball stopped events
- Root cause: BallEntity.setMoving() was emitting events that would trigger itself recursively
- Solution:
  1. Removed event emission from BallEntity.setMoving()
  2. Used pre-bound event handlers in Game.ts to prevent creating new bindings
  3. Stored handler references for proper cleanup
  4. Modified the update method to correctly handle ball state changes
  5. Added proper state tracking in BallEntity

### Bug Fix: Ball Reset Spam
- Problem: Multiple "Ball out of bounds" resets happening in quick succession
- Root cause: No debouncing on reset check, multiple physics updates triggering resets
- Solution:
  1. Added isResettingBall flag to prevent overlapping resets
  2. Implemented 500ms debounce timer to prevent rapid resets
  3. Used the ball's reset method for complete reset including velocity zeroing
  4. Added state checking to prevent unnecessary state transitions

### Component Architecture Benefits
- Each controller now has a single responsibility
- Parameter changes are centralized and propagated through events
- Physics calculations are isolated from visualization logic
- Clear interfaces between components simplify testing and extension
- Facade pattern reduces coupling between subsystems

### Event System Improvements
