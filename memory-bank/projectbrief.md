# Project Brief: Cosmic Rollers

## Project Overview
Cosmic Rollers is a physics-based golf game deeply inspired by Kirby's Dream Course, providing an engaging 3D isometric experience where players control a ball, navigating through procedurally generated courses to hit targets and reach goals in as few shots as possible.

## Core Goals
- Create a faithful recreation of Kirby's Dream Course physics and gameplay feel
- Implement procedural generation for infinite course variety
- Deliver a polished, performance-optimized 3D isometric game experience
- Build a modular and maintainable codebase with clean separation of concerns

## Core Requirements

### Essential Features
- Physics-based ball movement with realistic physics properties
- Two-phase shot control system (aiming phase and power phase)
- Multiple shot types (grounders, fly shots with spin variations)
- Procedurally generated courses using noise-based algorithms
- Isometric camera system with smooth follow behavior
- Targets and obstacles with appropriate physics interactions
- Goal system to track level completion
- Score tracking system

### Technical Requirements
- Maintain 60fps performance on mid-tier devices
- Implement clean architecture with separation between game systems
- Use Three.js for rendering and Rapier for physics
- Employ procedural generation for course variety
- Progressive development approach starting with core systems

## Project Timeline
12-week development timeline divided into 4 phases:
1. **Core Mechanics** (Weeks 1-3)
2. **Core Gameplay** (Weeks 4-7)
3. **Procedural Generation** (Weeks 8-10)
4. **Polish & Refinement** (Weeks 11-12)

## Success Criteria
- Completed game with all core features implemented
- Smooth performance (60fps) on target devices
- Intuitive controls that recreate the feel of Kirby's Dream Course
- Procedural generation system creating varied, playable courses
- Polished visuals, UI and game flow

# Cosmic Rollers - Project Brief

## Overview
Cosmic Rollers is a physics-based 3D golf game inspired by Kirby's Dream Course, built for modern web browsers using React, Three.js, and Rapier physics. Players control a colorful ball character navigating through vibrant isometric courses.

## Core Concept
Players control angle, power, and spin to hit targets scattered throughout each course. When a target is hit, it transforms into a collectible star, and the last target becomes the goal hole. The game features special abilities acquired from hitting specific targets.

## Technical Constraints
- **Code Modularity**: Keep files between 300-500 lines of code maximum
- **Core Technologies**: React, Three.js, Rapier physics, TypeScript
- **Target Platforms**: Modern web browsers, mobile devices

## Development Approach
- Prioritize a working app with proper rendering from day one
- Implement early playable prototype focusing on "feel" of ball movement
- Use Entity Component System (ECSY) architecture for better modularity

## Success Criteria
- Authentic "Dream Course" physics and camera feel
- Intuitive shot controls across platforms
- Visually appealing courses with varied gameplay elements
- Smooth performance on target devices
- Engaging progression with varied challenges
