# Overview
Cosmic Rollers is a physics-based golf game inspired by Kirby's Dream Course, built for modern web browsers. Players control a ball character navigating through colorful isometric courses, aiming to hit targets and reach a goal hole in as few shots as possible. The game combines precise physics mechanics with accessible controls, creating an experience that's easy to learn but challenging to master.

- **Why**: Creates the core gameplay loop of hitting all targets before reaching the goal
- **How**: Collision detection between ball and target objects, with visual feedback

## Basic UI Elements (MVP)
- **What**: Power meter, angle indicator, stroke counter, and minimal menus
- **Why**: Provides essential feedback and game state information
- **How**: Combination of HTML/CSS for menus and Three.js for in-game indicators
