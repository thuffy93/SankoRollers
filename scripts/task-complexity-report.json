      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Three.js and Rapier3D project setup into specific implementation steps, including environment configuration, library integration, folder structure setup, basic scene initialization, physics world configuration, and testing procedures.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up multiple technologies (Three.js, TypeScript, Rapier3D) with proper configuration. While not extremely complex, it requires careful integration of the physics engine with Three.js and establishing a solid project foundation. The configuration of build tools and proper TypeScript setup adds moderate complexity."

      "reasoning": "This task requires deep integration between Three.js visuals and Rapier3D physics, with precise parameter tuning. Implementing proper collision detection and synchronizing the visual representation with the physics body adds significant complexity. The movement methods need to be designed with future systems in mind."

      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for a three-phase golf shot system, including state machine design, visual indicators for aiming, power meter mechanics, spin control implementation, input handling across devices, physics force application, and game state transitions.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it involves creating a multi-phase input system with different interaction models. The state machine needs to handle various input methods, create appropriate visual feedback, and correctly translate player input into physics forces. The system is central to gameplay and requires careful design."
